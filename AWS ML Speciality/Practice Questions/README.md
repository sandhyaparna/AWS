### Key notes from practice exams
* When batch size should be decreased, decrease the learning rate also. similarity when they have to increase
* object2vec to vectorize sentences
* Instance Segmentation - Autonomous vehicle model
* When model takes too long to converge: Normalize data before sending or batch normalization
* Aws Sagemaker tuning jobs to tune hyperparameters
* Glue can convert data to parquet
* Firehose can convert JSON data to ORC or paquet format
* Advantages of Edge:
  * ML models will run upto 2x better performance
  * Required framework memory is reduced 10x
  * ML model can run on multiple hardware platforms
* AWS IoT Greengrass:
  * works offline
  * Respond to local events in near real-time
* Putobject is a legal API call
* One should always use AES256 encryption and wildcards are allowed in JSON policies
* MoveObject API call is illegal
* Number of mosquito bites - poisson Distribution
* prob of person contacting a disease - Binomial
* freq functions for IDF - Smoth, Probabilistic, Standard
* Algos that support pipe input mode and recordIO protobuf are PCA, K-means, Factorization machines, LDA, Neural Topic modeling, Linear Learner, Randomcut forest
* For notebooks in VPC - create Amazon sagemaker VPC interface endpoints within the corporate VPC
* ML code in DocerFile to run own algo: COPY and ENTRYPOINT
* Install Docker compose for local training on his laptop
