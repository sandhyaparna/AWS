* Database is specifically for Online Transaction Processing. Within each database, data is organized into tables and columns. Within each column, you can define a description of the data, such as integer, data field, or string. Tables can be organized inside of schemas, which you can think of as folders. When data is ingested, it is stored in various tables described by the schema. Query tools use the schema to determine which data tables to access and analyze.
* Data Warehouse is specifically for Online Analytical Processing. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. It consolidates data from many sources. 
* A data warehouse is specially designed for data analytics, which involves reading large amounts of data to understand relationships and trends across the data. A database is used to capture and store data, such as recording details of a transaction.
* Unlike a data warehouse, a data lake is a centralized repository for all data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. A data warehouse requires that the data be organized in a tabular format, which is where the schema comes into play. The tabular format is needed so that SQL can be used to query the data. But not all applications require data to be in tabular format.
